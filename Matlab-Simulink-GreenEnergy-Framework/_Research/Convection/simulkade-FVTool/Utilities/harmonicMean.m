function phiFaceAverage = harmonicMean(MeshStructure, phi)
% This function gets the value of the field variable phi defined
% over the MeshStructure and calculates the harmonic average on 
% the cell faces, for a uniform mesh.
% The field variable must include the values of the ghost (boundary cells).
% otherwise, the value of the ghost cells will be added to the variable,
% assuming a zero gradient on the surface.
