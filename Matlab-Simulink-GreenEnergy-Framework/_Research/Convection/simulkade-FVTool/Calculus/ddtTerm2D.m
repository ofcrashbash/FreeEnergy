function ddt = ddtTerm2D(MeshStructure, dt, phi)
% function ddt = ddtTerm2D(MeshStructure, dt, phi)
% it returns the derivative of phi with respect to time in the vector ddt
% phi is a structure with elements phi.value and phi.Old
% mesh structure is used to map the (phi.value-phi.Old) matrix in the
% ddt vector
