function MeshStructure = buildMeshCylindrical2D(Nr, Ny, Lr, Ly)
% MeshStructure = buildMeshCylindrical2D(Nr, Ny, Lr, Ly)
% builds a uniform 2D mesh on a cylindrical coordinate:
% Nr is the number of cells in r (radial) direction
% Ny is the number of cells in y (vertical) direction
% Lr is the domain length in r direction
% Ly is the domain length in y direction
% 
% SYNOPSIS:
%   MeshStructure = buildMeshCylindrical2D(Nr, Ny, Lr, Ly)
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%   Nr: number of cells in the x direction
%   Lr: domain length in x direction
%   Ny: number of cells in the y direction
%   Ly: domain length in y direction
% 
% RETURNS:
%   MeshStructure.
%                 dimensions=2.5 (2D problem, cylindrical coordinate)
%                 numbering: shows the indexes of cellsn from left to right
%                 and top to bottom
%                 cellsize: r and y elements of the cell size =[Lr/Nr,
%                 Ly/Ny]
%                 cellcenters.x: location of each cell in the r direction
%                 cellcenters.y: location of each cell in the y direction
%                 facecenters.x: location of interface between cells in the
%                 r direction
%                 facecenters.y: location of interface between cells in the
%                 y direction
%                 numberofcells: [Nr, Ny]
%

% EXAMPLE:
%   Nr = 5;
%   Ny = 7;
%   R = 10;
%   Ly = 20;
%   m = buildMeshCylindrical2D(Nx, Ny, Lx, Ly);
%   [X, Y] = ndgrid(m.cellcenters.x, m.cellcenters.y);
%   [Xf,Yf]=ndgrid(m.facecenters.x, m.facecenters.y);
%   plot(X, Y, 'or', ...
%        Xf, Yf, '-b', Xf', Yf', '-b');
