function MeshStructure = buildMesh1D(Nx, Width)
% MeshStructure = buildMesh1D(Nx, Width)
% builds a uniform 1D mesh:
% Nx is the number of cells in x (horizontal) direction
% Width is the domain length in x direction
% 
% SYNOPSIS:
%   MeshStructure = buildMesh1D(Nx, Width)
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%   Nx: number of cells in the domain
%   Width: domain length
% 
% RETURNS:
%   MeshStructure.
%                 dimensions=1 (1D problem)
%                 numbering: shows the indexes of cellsn from left to right
%                 dx: cell size (=Width/Nx)
%                 cellcenters.x: location of each cell in the x direction
%                 facecenters.x: location of interface between cells in the
%                 x direction
%                 numberofcells: Nx
%                                  
% 
% EXAMPLE:
%   L = 1.0; % length of the domain
%   Nx = 10; % number of cells in the domain
%   m = buildMesh1D(Nx, L);
%   plot(m.cellcenters.x, ones(size(m.cellcenters.x)), 'o', ...
%        m.facecenters.x, ones(size(m.facecenters.x)), '-+');
%   legend('cell centers', 'face centers');
