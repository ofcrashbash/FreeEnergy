%   Lz: domain length in z direction
% 
% RETURNS:

%                 dimensions=3 (3D problem)
%                 numbering: shows the indexes of cellsn from left to right
%                 and top to bottom and back to front
%                 cellsize: x, y, and z elements of the cell size =[Lx/Nx,
%                 Ly/Ny, Lz/Nz]
%                 cellcenters.x: location of each cell in the x direction

%                 cellcenters.z: location of each cell in the z direction
%                 facecenters.x: location of interface between cells in the
%                 x direction
%                 facecenters.y: location of interface between cells in the
%                 y direction
%                 facecenters.z: location of interface between cells in the
%                 z direction

%   [Xf, Yf, Zf] = ndgrid(m.facecenters.x, m.facecenters.y, m.facecenters.z);
%   plot3(X(:), Y(:), Z(:), 'or')
%   hold on;
