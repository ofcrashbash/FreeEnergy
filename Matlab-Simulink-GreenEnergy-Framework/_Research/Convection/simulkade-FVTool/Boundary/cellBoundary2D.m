function phiBC = cellBoundary2D(MeshStructure, BC, phi)
% function phiBC = cellBoundary2D(MeshStructure, BC, phi)
% It creates the matrix of coefficient based on the BC structure provided 
% by the user. It also generates the right hand side vector of the linear
% system of equations
% 
% SYNOPSIS:
%   phiBC = cellBoundary2D(MeshStructure, BC, phi)
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%   MeshStructure: a mesh structure created by buildMesh* functions
%   BC: boundary condition structure created by createBC function
%   phi: cell variable created by createCellVariable
% 
% RETURNS:
%   phiBC: a cell variable including the values of the ghost cells
% 
% EXAMPLE:
%   m = buildMesh2D(3,4,1,1);
%   phi = createCellVariable(m,1);
%   bc = createBC(m);
%   phi_with_ghost = cellBoundary(m,bc,phi)
