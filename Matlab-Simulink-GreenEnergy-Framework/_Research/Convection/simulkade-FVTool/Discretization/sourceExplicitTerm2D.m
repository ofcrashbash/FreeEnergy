% extract data from the mesh structure
G = MeshStructure.numbering;
Nxy = MeshStructure.numberofcells;
Nx = Nxy(1); Ny = Nxy(2);

% rearrange the matrix of k and build the sparse matrix for internal cells
row_index = reshape(G(2:Nx+1,2:Ny+1),Nx*Ny,1); % main diagonal (only internal cells)

% define the RHS Vector
RHS = zeros((Nx+2)*(Ny+2),1);

% assign the values of the RHS vector
RHS(row_index) = reshape(phi,Nx*Ny,1);
